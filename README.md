"# APIAutomation" 
The API Automation project has been established solely for demonstration objectives. It serves as an example to illustrate the development of a project framework. For this purpose, I've employed a sample project structure along with several open-source APIs, similar to those I utilized during my learning journey in API automation.



Steps to Run this Project
1. mvn test verify (It runs entire project)
2. mvn test verify -Dcucumber.options="--tags@tagname"
